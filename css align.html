Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Joe Biden held their first summit in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday. After the meeting, Putin said in his one-man press conference that his encounter with Biden was "constructive," and that both countries had agreed their ambassadors would return to their posts in Moscow and Washington. This meeting clearly shows that both sides have the will to stop the worsening US-Russia relationship which is "at a post-Cold War low." Compared with the two countries' mutual hostility, this is already an adjustment. In this sense, the smooth holding of the meeting itself can be regarded as an achievement.

Putin also said that the two countries discussed a number of topics including strategic stability, trade relations, regional security and cybersecurity. 

However, the US and Russia have fundamental differences on issues such as Ukraine, Syria, Belarus and human rights, which can hardly be resolved in just one meeting. When former US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama entered the White House, they both showed a public willingness to restart US-Russia relations. But when they left the Oval Office, the bilateral relations worsened. When Biden came into power, the language he used on Russia was even tougher than those of his two predecessors. Biden is obviously the new president who is more "anti-Russia." But he has an additional motivation to ease the US-Russia tensions - he wants to concentrate on dealing with China now.

But as Russia is too big and too powerful, the US-Russia relationship is not a simple game in which Washington can make any adjustment at will. Regarding the important differences between Russia and the US, no matter which side makes a concession, it will lead to a major impact.

Most importantly, there is a problem with the US' attitude toward its differences with Russia. The US has formed an oppressive attitude on Russia, which lacks basic respect. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the US has shown its arrogance and tough stance as a victorious nation. Washington implemented NATO's eastward expansion that frantically squeezed Moscow's strategic space, and frequently led allies to jointly impose sanctions on and humiliate Moscow. The summit was clearly not the end of Washington's bad attitude, as Putin reportedly said, "I did not have any illusions to begin with. They do not and cannot exist."

In the field of cybersecurity and human rights, Washington has arbitrarily convicted Moscow, and there is no equality between these two major powers at all.

The US has talked about Russia's "aggressiveness," but it is mostly Russia's resistance at the red line when being squeezed by the US and other Western countries. In fact, Russia has nowhere to retreat. To ease US-Russia relations, the only method is Washington taking a step or even a few steps back.
