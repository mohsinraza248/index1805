            As the debate surrounding the origins of the COVID-19 virus has long branched out as Western politicians and media's muzzle of China-bashing, and individuals' tool to gain personal fame, Chinese and foreign scientists who buried their heads in studying the puzzle have also been pushed out front, such as Shi Zhengli. They decided to break their silence, and hopefully they can veer virus tracing back to a "scientific and rational" way.
